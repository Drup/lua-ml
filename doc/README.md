## Lua - an extensible extension language

Abstract. This paper describes Lua, a language for extending applications. Lua
combines procedural features with powerful data description facilities, by
using a simple, yet powerful, mechanism of tables. This mechanism implements
the concepts of records, arrays, and recursive data types (pointers), and adds
some object-oriented facilities, such as methods with dynamic dispatching. Lua
presents a mechanism of fallbacks that allows programmers to extend the
semantics of the language in some unconventional ways. As a noteworthy
example, fallbacks allow the user to add different kinds of inheritance to the
language. Currently, Lua is being extensively used in production for several
tasks, including user configuration, general-purpose data-entry, description
of user interfaces, storage of structured graphical metafiles, and generic
attribute configuration for finite element meshes.
